# OpenVR Fly Configuration
# Make a copy of this file and rename it to begin with a number from 1 to 9 to define a custom configuration. Only modify the values after the colons.

# The number of milliseconds to wait between each position update (20ms ~= 50 updates per second). To convert from updates per second, divide 1000 by your desired updates per second.
# Note that your true update rate may be lower due to the time it takes to do each update. In-game speed does not change as a result of changing this number.
UpdateDelay: 20

# The controller button that is used to enable or disable flying.
# Can be Trigger, Menu, Touchpad, or Grip.
ControlButton: Grip

# true = Press and hold the control button on either controller to enable flying for both controllers. Let go of both control buttons to disable flying.
# false = Double press the control button to enable flying for that controller. Press the control button again to disable flying for that controller.
HoldToFly: false

# true = Press the control button while flying is enabled to return to your original location. Hold the control button until the controller vibrates to disable flying for that controller.
# false = Press the control button while flying is enabled to disable flying for that controller. Disable flying for both controllers to return to your original location.
# Ignored if HoldToFly is true.
EnableQuickReturn: true

# The controller button that is used to control flying.
# Can be Touchpad or Trigger.
FlyButton: Touchpad

# Use the x axis of the touchpad to control flying? (true/false)
# Ignored if FlyButton is not Touchpad.
UseXAxis: true

# Use the y axis of the touchpad to control flying? (true/false)
# Ignored if FlyButton is not Touchpad.
UseYAxis: true

# true = Use parabolic speed (slower at first, but more rapidly approaches the max speed later).
# false = Use linear speed.
ParabolicSpeed: true

# The maximum fly speed in meters/second... I think.
MaxSpeed: 30

# The position on your touchpad that has 0 speed.
# Can be Top, Left, Right, Bottom, Center, or Start.
# Start means start at 0 speed when you first touch the touchpad, increasing speed as you move your finger away from that position.
# Ignored if FlyButton is not Touchpad.
ZeroPosition: Center

# Horizontal = Only fly in the x and z directions (no vertical movement).
# Vertical = Only fly in the y direction (only vertical movement).
# Snap = Snap to horizontal or vertical movement depending on which is closer to the direction you're trying to fly in. This option applies per controller.
# All = Fly in all directions.
PossibleFlyDirections: All

# true = Black out much of your peripheral vision while flying in an attempt to reduce motion sickness... not sure if this actually helps since I don't get sick in VR, but give it a shot if you do.
# false = Do not restrict your vision while flying.
RestrictVision: false
